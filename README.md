TWRP_THEME_PORTER
==================

Informal Update: I have been seeing on XDA and AF that I was mysteriously banished with no explanation. Seems my Port script has taken a big hit so I wanted to inform you all that I willingly chose to be less active on XDA and AF so that I may be with family more often than not. Thanks for understanding.

Please, should you have the time and decide to adjust the codes then I insist you send it my way for review and so I may even possibly merge to my repo. Thanks!

-- Happy Hunting!!

LOLLIPOP SUPPORT:

GraphicsMagick and pngcrush are compiled statically with 03 optimization. They will work on your device.

As of version 5.4, the modded Lollipop linker file is not needed since GraphicsMagick was successfully compiled statically so please insure you uninstall it or manually fix it. Version 5.4 and onward will not give the option to uninstall the modded Lollipop linker file.

Version 5.0 up to 5.3.3 only supports the Lollipop linker hack and only those versions will offer the option to uninstall it for you.

To manually fix it look at /system/bin on your device and find linker.mymind as it is your original linker file. Rename it to, linker, by removing the .mymind extension.
